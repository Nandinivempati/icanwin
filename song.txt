If I could only find a note to make you understand
I’d sing it softly in your ear and grab you by the hand
Just keep me stuck inside your head, like your favorite tune
And know my heart’s a stereo that only plays for you

My heart’s a stereo
It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every no-o-o-te
Make me your radio
And turn me up when you feel low (turn it up a little bit)
This melody was meant for you
Just sing along to my stereo
